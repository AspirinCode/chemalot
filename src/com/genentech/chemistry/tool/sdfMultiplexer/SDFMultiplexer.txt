SDFMultiplexer -in inFile -out outFile [-shell shell] -nProc n [-cmd cmdLine|-cmdFile fn]
              [-groupByTitle] [-groupByAtomCount] [-errFilePrefix prefix]
   -in ............. InputFile, must be sdf, ".sdf" for stdin
   -out ............ OutputFile, must be sdf, ".sdf" for stdout
   -shell .......... shell used to execute cmdLine, default="$SHELL -fc"
                     This affects only subsequent -nProc parameters.
                     The string is tokenized splitting on spaces.
   -nProc .......... number of processes to start
                     -shell and -nProc may be repeated to start multiple executions
                     with different remote-shells
   -cmd ............ commandLine to be executed in each process
                     This is not tokenized.
                     $procNum,$batchNum is replaced with the number of the process/batch.
                     $currentDir is replaced with the directory of this process.
   -cmdFile ........ ifileName of file containing commandLine to be executed in
                     each process.
                     $procNum,$batchNum is replaced with the number of the process/batch.
                     $currentDir is replaced with the directory of this process.
  -stopOnError ..... Do not start new batch if previous batched exited with error code (!=0).                   
  -maxCrashRecover . maximum number of restart for each process upon a crash.
                     Default = 10
  -batchSize ....... stop processes after batchSize molecules and restart them.
                     -batchSize 1 is useful to debug crashing programs
                     -batchSize n could be useful to get more continuous output
                                from processes buffering their output
  -groupByTitle .... Keep consecutive molfiles with same title together.
  -groupByAtomCount  Keep consecutive molfiles with same atoms & bonds counts together.
  -errFilePrefix.... Write error output of each process into separate file with this prefix.
                     Default: write to stderr.
  -startDelay        Delay between startups of the subProcesses in ms. This can be used
                     if the subprocesses use the timestamp for temporary files to
                     avaoid collissions on the filename.

Notes: 1.) Use SDFMultiplexer only for programs that work independently on single records.
       2.) The input order is not retained in the output file.

stdErr of all processes will be redirected to the stdErr of this process.

The example below will start 2 local and 2 remote processes:
  sdfMultiplexer.pl -in big.sdf -out finalOut.sdf \
     -nProc 2 \
     -shell "ssh remoteNode" -nProc 2 \
     -cmd 'tee $currentDir/$HOST.$procNum.out|tee $currentDir/$HOST.$procNum.2.out'
